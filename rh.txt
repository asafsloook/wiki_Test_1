We define leadership as the ability to influence a group toward the
achievement of a vision or set of goals. The source of this influence may be
formal, such as that provided by managerial rank in an organization. But
not all leaders are managers, nor, for that matter, are all managers leaders.
Just because an organization provides its managers with certain formal
rights is no assurance they will lead effectively. Nonsanctioned leadershipthe
ability to influence that arises outside the formal structure of the
organization-is often as important or more important than formal influence.
In other words, leaders can emerge from within a group as well as by
formal appointment.
